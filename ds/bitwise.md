## The & (bitwise AND)
- The result of AND is 1 only if "both" bits are 1
- Example: 1 & 1 = 1

## The | (bitwise OR) 
- The result of OR is 1 if "any" of the two bits is 1. 
- Example: 1 | 1 = 1

## The ^ (bitwise XOR)
- The result of XOR is 1 if both bits are "different". 
- Example 1 ^ 1 = 0 

## The << (left shift)
- left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
- Exmaple 0010 << 1 => 0100

## The >> (right shift)
- right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
- Exmaple 0010 >> 1 => 0001

## The ~ (bitwise NOT)
- inverts all bits of it 
- Example 0010 => 1101
